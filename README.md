# Library Management System (Frontend Only)

A fully functional *Library Management System* (LMS) built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This system simulates user login, book borrowing, and admin-level controls â€” all powered entirely on the frontend using localStorage.

## ðŸš§ Known Limitations / Future Scope

- status and admin-side search button are not functional yet

- Users can only see due date, not *borrow date* in profile
- Borrow history only shows currently borrowed books (no past borrow log)
- No backend integration (currently frontend-only)
